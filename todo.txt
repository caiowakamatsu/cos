Stage 0: Real mode
Primary goal of stage 0 is to load stage 1 and give us a "sane" 16 bit environment (How sane can that be anyways though...)
- Setup segment registers / Stack
- Load stage 1 into memory
- Jump to stage 1

Stage 1: Real mode
Primary goal here is to do all the bootstraping required for data that we can't get without interrupts, then jump to 32 bit mode)
- Query / Load memory map E820h)
- Query / set VBE
- Prepare boot info struct
- Disable ints
- Load stage 2

Stage 2: Protected mode
Primary goal is to prepare the environment for the kernel to run
- Setup initial page tables (Recursive mapping)
- Prepare everything required for long mode 
- 64 bit jump BABYYYYYY


Kernel: Long mode
This is where the fun begins...
