Boot drive format:
sector[0] = Bootloader stage 0 (required)
sector[1] = Filesystem data*

Filesystem data
{
	uint16_t entry_count; // How many file entries do we have?
	uint16_t consumed_sectors; // How many sectors after this one?
	// Rest of the sector is reserved
}

File Entry 
{
	char identifier[32]; // "kernel.bin", "stage1.bin", etc...
	uint32_t sector_start; // What sector does the file start at?
	uint32_t sector_count; // How many sectors does the file span?
	uint32_t entry_size; // How many bytes is the actual file?
	uint8_t checksum; // xor hash of all bytes in file 
	char padding[19]; // 8 entries per sector
}
